Self-made CMDlets that I created to use from a CMD prompt. The parent directory is added to the PATH environment variable so I can use them anywhere.

 \
"[gitHelper.bat](gitHelper.bat)" makes git easier, for me. The custom/reduced help text and flags streamlines git use.

"[newCMDlet.bat](./newCMDlet.bat)" and "[newscript.bat](newscript.bat)" take a name for a new script/CMDlet, creates the file in the appropriate directory, and opens it for editing.

"[pop.bat](pop.bat)" and "[push.bat](push.bat)" are 'aliases' for popd and pushd because I don't want to enter an extra 'd' every time.
