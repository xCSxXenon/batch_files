A collection of batch scripts I wrote to automate and simplify my workflows. Written and maintained by me unless specified otherwise.

  \
"[Show Sorting](./Show%20Sorting/)" contains scripts I use for renaming and sorting episodic-style releases from independent creators.

"[File Selector Template.bat](./File%20Selector%20Template.bat)" opens a file browsing window so you can select a file. It then displays some details about the selected file. Useful for selecting a file for processing graphically instead of CLI. Main functional code found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15885132/file-folder-chooser-dialog-from-a-windows-batch-script). Output/formatting by me.

"[Get Drive Letter From Volume Name.bat](Get%20Drive%20Letter%20From%20Volume%20Name.bat)" takes a volume name as argument and echos its drive letter. Code included and used in
"[Lock BitLocked Volume.bat](./Lock%20BitLocked%20Volume.bat)".

"[Lock BitLocked Volume.bat](Lock%20BitLocked%20Volume.bat)" takes a volume name as a argument and locks it. I use it to leave a process running and have it lock when finished.
