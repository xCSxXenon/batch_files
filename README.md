A collection of batch scripts I wrote to automate and simplify my workflows. Written and maintained by me unless specified otherwise.

"File Selector Template.bat" opens a file browsing window so you can select a file. It then displays some details about the selected file. Useful for selecting a file for processing graphically instead of CLI. Main functional code found somewhere else. Output/formatting by me.

"Get Drive Letter From Volume Name.bat" takes a volume name as argument and echos its drive letter. Used in
"[Lock BitLocked Volume.bat](./Lock%20BitLocked%20Volume.bat)".

"Lock BitLocked Volume.bat" takes a volume name as a argument and locks it. I use it to leave a process running and have it lock when finished.
