Self-made CMDlets that I created to use from a CMD prompt. The parent directory is added to the PATH environment variable so I can use them anywhere.



"gitHelper.bat" makes git easier, for me. The custom/reduced help text and flags streamlines git use.
"newCMDlet.bat" takes a name for a new CMDlet script, creates the file in this directory, and opens it for editing.
"newscript.bat" takes a name for a new script, creates the file in my 'Scripts" directory, and opens it for editing.
"pop.bat" and "push.bat" are 'aliases' for popd and pushd because why do I have to enter an extra 'd' every time?
